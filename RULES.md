# Objective

The goal of the game is to reach 30 points. Points are scored by solving RadGab puzzles. A RadGab puzzle is a set of unrelated words (or Gibberish), that when said in the right way, sounds like a familiar phrase, name, place, etc. When it's your team's turn, you will try and solve three puzzles before the timer runs out. If you solve all three, you may gain bonus points. If you miss any, the stealing team may get points by solving missed clues.

# Setup

The setup is simple, simply divide players into two teams and decide which team is the red team and which is the blue team. Decide which team will go first. Going first does not illicit any advantage.

# Gameplay

When it is your team's turn, select a Coach and a Guesser. You can also choose to have all players who are not the Coach be the Guessers, however, we recommend going one player at a time. The Coach should ensure that they are on the Coach view and the guesser(s) should be on the Guesser view. The opposing team will choose 1 stealer.

When the Guesser is ready, they may click "Start Turn". The Guesser will see a RadGab puzzle and the Coach will see the solution. The Guesser will sound out the clue and try to solve the puzzle. If they get it right, the Coach will click "Correct" and a new clue will be loaded. The Guesser can also give up and click "Pass" o pass the clue at any time, but this will forfeit your bonus! Once three puzzles are solved or passed, or the timer runs out, your turn is over. If you got all three clues correct, you may be awarded bonus points based on how fast you were able to get through them. If you miss any clues, the stealer on the other team will get the chance to solve the clues and get points. The stealer cannot see any of the past clues and must solve them from memory.

After the stealing phase, the turn then switches to the other team.

# Coaching

The Coach is there to guide the Guesser. The Coach *cannot look at the clue*, only the solution. The Coach will then guide the Guesser on how to say the clue to reach the solution, i.e what words to emphasize, how fast to say certain syllables, etc.

# Points

Each puzzle solved is worth one point for the Guesser's team. If all three puzzles are solved in a turn, up to three bonus points may be awarded depending on how fast the three puzzles were solved. Each puzzle stolen is worth one point for the Stealer's team.

# Winning

The first team to get 30 points wins the game. However, if the team that goes first is the first to reach 30 points, the other team gets an additional round to make sure that each team gets the same number of rounds. After this round, whichever team has the highest score wins. If the team that went second gets to 30 points first, the game is automatically over.

# Difficulty

There are two difficulty options: Easy and Regular. With easy, each word in the clue matches up with a word in the solution. With Regular, the spacing within the clues is also mixed up. We strongly recommend playing on Regular.
